Linux Network Internals

Linux Network driver comprises of PCI and Ethernet
Pci is the bus driver
Ethernet is the device driver
Linux Network device driver creation can be divided into below parts

-Initialization
-Packet reception
-Packet transmission
-Status/Control
-Uninitialisation


Intialisation
-Register the driver with the kernel
-Register PCI driver with the kernel
-Allocate memory for the packet alloc_ether
-Initialise DMA,allocate coherant memory
-Intialize Interrupt handler
-Populate net_dev structure
-On driver name match with the device tree, probe is invoked
-In probe pci_is_enabled()

Packet Reception
-On packet arrival,rx interrupt is triggered
-NAPI/interrupt enabled
-Packets received queued into rx buffer queue to be passed to higher layers(TCP.IP)

PAcket Transmission

Status/Control
